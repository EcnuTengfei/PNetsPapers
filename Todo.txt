Todo
  - [DONE] LOTOS Enable Example: Improve the example graph, Adding the "forall".
  - Do the intermediate variable elimination before the submition to Z3.
      - [CHANGED] Find the order of the equations.
          - [DONE] Exchange some of the original order. e.g. r_11 = delta(x).
      - [DONE] Substitude the term on the RHS of the guards.
      - Unification.
      - [DONE] Find the ground according to the definition.
      - [DONE] Considering: Do that during the "Making Transitions".
  - New example for tracking the transition of the input variable.
      - CCS : ?a(x).tau.!b(x).P.
  - Check whether CVC4 has simpler way to reason data structure.
  - [DONE] Control the print level of the log.
      - log4j2 have a .xml file to control the print level.
  - [DONE] Substitute the intermediate variable in the guard with the non-inermediate one.
      - Add new function substGuard() in MakeTransition. Every time predicate terms created, it will be invoked to check if there are intermediate variables and substitute them.
  - [DONE] CCS Example
      - Missing terms in the predicate (the term contains TAU).
        - It is because the result of the SV such as TAU isn't collected in the ground terms.Fix the *collectGrndTermFromSV(SyncVector sv)*.
  - [DONE] BIPArchFailureTimer
      - Strange assignement (the decrease of the counter) "{t := (t1)}", should be "{t := (t - 1)}".
  - [DONE] Warning that FUN and Synchro haven't declared.
      - Add a new method to declare those default functions.

Updated 2017.09.25
  - Intermediate variable elimination algorithm.
      - Consider the case that there are expressions instead of variables when checking the elements of the equation. That may need to figure out the variables contained in the expression and deal with them.
      - Conduct the elimination after the checking method using the information of the intermediate variables collected before.
      - Prove the correctness of the algorithm, giving out mathematic discription.

Updated 2017.10.02
  - Keep trace with the bugs in FailureTimer example: The Global State "S2_T1" (Deadlock?).
      - The "reset" action may should start at this state.
      - The "timeout" action may should add to the s2 and s0.
  - Change print-level of origin OTs (before checking) to DEBUG.
  - Print the pNet architecture in different console.
